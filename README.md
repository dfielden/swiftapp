# swiftapp
A short project created using technology completely that I was unfamililar with.
Tech: Swift, Xcode, Java, Spring Boot, HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
Created a very simple iOS app, comprising a single button and a simple webpage with text telling users to wait for an image to appear.
When users push the button on the iOS app, the image on the website appears for one second before disappearing again.
One way communication achieved by using an SSE (server-sent event) emitter on the server side and an EventSource on the client side.
